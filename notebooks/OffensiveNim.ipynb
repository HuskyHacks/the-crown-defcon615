    "After looking at Nim malware from the defensive perspective, let's examine the other side of the coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nim is a fantastic malware development language for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elegent, easy access to the Win API via the winim library (we saw this with the ShellExecute binary example).\n",
    "- Nim compiled binaries are compiled directly to native C/C++ code. Your malware binaries do not rely on the existence of an interpreter or virtual machine to execute.\n",
    "- Nim binaries are tiny compared to other cross-compileable, statically-linked languages like Go and Rust.\n",
    "- Winim can also call the Component Object Model (COM) directly which allows for flexibility of post-exploitation execution.\n",
    "- Easy generation of Windows DLLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OffensiveNim\n",
    "aka \"The Sacred Texts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[OffensiveNim](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim) is Marcello Salvati's (aka byt3bl33d3r) research repository for the offensive application of Nim. No talk on Nim malware would be complete without mentioning his incredible work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository has several powerful proof of concepts for a wide range of offensive activities, from classic [CreateRemoteThread shellcode injection](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/shellcode_bin.nim) to [minidumping LSASS](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/minidump_bin.nim) to [keylogging](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/keylogger_bin.nim) to [things so dope I don't even understand what they are doing](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/taskbar_ewmi_bin.nim).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: CreateRemoteThread Shellcode Injection\n",
    "Let's examine a simple POC from this repository to see an example of how Nim's chartacteristics lend itself to malware development."
